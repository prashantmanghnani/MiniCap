# LAPD Crime Data Analysis 2020

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of crime data in Los Angeles for the year 2020. The Jupyter Notebook within this repository explores various aspects of the crime data including temporal trends, spatial distribution, victim demographics, and the status of crime investigations.

## Overview

The analysis delves into the LAPD's publicly available crime data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that could aid in better understanding and possibly mitigating crime in Los Angeles. The notebook is structured as follows:

- **Importing Necessary Libraries**: Setup and preparation for analysis, including the import of necessary Python libraries.
- **Database Connection Setup**: Instructions and code for connecting to the database containing the crime data.
- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the dataset, including a summary of its contents and structure.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Examination of crime trends over time, particularly the impact of COVID-19 lockdowns on crime rates.
- **Spatial Analysis**: Identification of geographical hotspots for crimes and analysis of spatial patterns.
- **Victim Demographics**: Analysis of victim age distribution, gender differences, and common locations for reported crimes.
- **Status Analysis**: Review of the status of crime investigations and outcomes.

## Key Insights

- A significant decrease in overall crime rates following COVID-19 lockdowns.
- Identification of urban public spaces and residences as common crime locations.
- Analysis of geographical hotspots suggesting specific neighborhoods or areas experience higher crime rates.
- Age distribution and gender difference among crime victims, highlighting younger individuals as especially vulnerable.
- Distribution of reported crimes, with a focus on Burglary from Vehicle, Simple Assault, and Theft.

## Questions Addressed

1. **Spatial Analysis**: Identifying geographical hotspots and the impact on urban safety.
2. **Victim Demographics**: Understanding the distribution by age and gender.
3. **Location Analysis**: Analyzing common crime locations for targeted interventions.
4. **Crime Code Analysis**: Distribution of reported crimes and implications for public safety.
